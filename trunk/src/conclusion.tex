%Conclusion
In this paper, we demonstrated the Refresh Enabled Video Analytics (REVA) system, which is tuned to optimize energy utilization of the memory by exploiting data characteristics in vision-based applications. In this system we showed that depending on the region of interest (RoI) in an image stored in memory, the need for refresh varies from row to row across each memory bank. By adjusting refresh rates selectively depending the need for re-use of different regions of interest in video frames, we demonstrated an 88.1\% improvement in refresh power and a 14.8\% improvement in overall power over existing DRAM schemes.
