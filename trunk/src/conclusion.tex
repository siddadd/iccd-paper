%Conclusion
In this paper, we demonstrated the Refresh Enabled Video Analytics system, which is tuned to optimize energy utilization of the memory by exploiting data characteristics in vision-based applications. We showed that depending on the RoI stored in memory, the need for refresh varies from row to row across each memory bank. By adjusting refresh rates selectively depending on the need for re-use of different RoIs, we demonstrate 88\% improvement in refresh power and 15\% improvement in overall power over existing DRAM schemes.
