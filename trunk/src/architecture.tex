%Architecture
%In this section we describe in detail the system architecture, in particular the memory hierarchies along with the data mapping and refresh policies that we adopt.

Figure~\ref{fig:reva}a) illustrates the baseline architecture for the vision analytics-based system. The input video is captured by the HD camera at a rate of 30 frames/s. 
These frames are stored in the off-chip DRAM, as shown in the figure. These frames are then read by the saliency accelerator and a \emph{Saliency Map} is computed. It is then used to compute the RoIs. The Object Recognition accelerator classifies the objects in each RoI. The Action Recognition Engine requires a series of consecutive frames for action classification. Since each of these frames over the entire length of the video is stored in the main memory module, there is substantial overhead in terms of refresh energy. In our proposed design, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reva}b), the DRAM primarily serves the purpose of a stream buffer. Consequently the frames are rarely reused after processing, which may eliminate the need for refresh. 
However, some accelerator operations like action recognition, require a sequence of previously stored frames to be recalled. Therefore we only need to \emph{selectively} refresh the RoIs involved in these functions. We thus propose \emph{Differential Refresh} rates based on the RoI and object class with which it has been associated by the object recognition engine.

\subsection{Differential Refresh Architecture}
As explained above, in the time duration of Refresh Cycle Time ($t_{RFC}$), a group of rows is refreshed sequentially when a refresh pulse is scheduled. When a refresh pulse is sent every Refresh Interval ($t_{ref}$) time period, we keep track of the next row to be refreshed in a bank in the \emph{Next Row Address} register. At the end of every refresh iteration, the content of this register is sent to the memory controller. 
We maintain an on-chip CAM structure called the \emph{RoI Address Table (RAT)} to list RoIs in each frame and their corresponding starting addresses and sizes. The RAT is analogous to the processor register file with each new RoI resulting in a new entry being written into it. 
Since the action recognition accelerator requires around 20 frames for a reasonably accurate classification, assuming a maximum of 4 RoIs per frame, the RAT can have a maximum of 80 entries. When the address of the next row to be refreshed does not match an RoI address on associative search, Refresh Enable signal is set to 0. This ensures that rows of an image in a bank that do not belong to RoIs are refreshed less frequently than the rows that contain RoIs. 

Each frame is interleaved across banks at page granularity. The RAT is updated once the saliency accelerator computes the RoIs as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reva}c). After a refresh iteration, when the memory controller gets the Next\_Row\_Address and a match for this is found in the RAT, a refresh pulse is sent to the command queue; otherwise Refresh Enable signal is set to low. An RoI is a 2-d rectangular tile and might correspond to different rows in different banks; the group of rows containing a portion of the RoI might also have non-RoI regions striped across multiple banks. The energy overhead of refreshing non-RoI regions in rows that contain RoI is less than that incurred on applying a uniform auto-refresh policy to the entire image. Since the non-RoI regions of the image are not subsequently read/written to, we allow the non-critical sections of the image to degrade with infrequent refreshes. On the other hand, non-image data such as code are considered to be critical and assigned a standard auto-refresh policy. It needs to be noted that for completely stream-based processing, a no-refresh policy can be implemented since each image row is read no more than once.
 
\subsection{Comparison with existing schemes}
Selectively refreshing the DRAM depending on data criticality has been demonstrated earlier in~\cite{Liu2011}. 
However, their scheme proposed mapping physical pages of an RoI to a specific partition in the bank, incurring additional OS overhead. In contrast, REVA does not involve page-level mapping of Virtual Addresses of RoIs to physical pages of a partition. 
Also, when the saliency accelerator generates the saliency map, RoIs are not re-written to dedicated variable refresh frequency partitions. Instead, the saliency map is used to derive RoIs in the input image already stored in memory and refresh frequencies are dynamically varied based on the RoI locations.
%Unlike their scheme which consists of a static partitioning of the memory depending on the required refresh rate, our system is capable of dynamically allocating refresh periods to stripes of rows across banks. Consequently, by interleaving data across all banks, it is possible to control the refresh rates of each individual RoI. 
%This also eliminates the need for the refresh regions to be re-written into a separate section of pre-allocated memory, as in the case of~\cite{Liu2011}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:reva-refresh} contrasts the two schemes described above. It can be observed that REVA makes dynamic refresh allocations, which lends more flexibility and reduces the need for redundant RoI writes.
REVA involves additional communication overhead between memory controller and refresh controller since the address of the next row to be refreshed is sent after every refresh iteration. 
To compute these overheads, we use McPAT 1.0~\cite{mcpat} to estimate the power of the CAM-based RAT. Our experiments resulted in an additional power of around 2.4~mW, which is less than 1\% of the overall system power.
