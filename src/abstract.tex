Video applications are becoming ubiquitous in mobile and embedded systems. Wearable video systems such as Google glasses require capabilities for real-time video analytics and prolonged battery lifetimes. Further, the increasing resolution of image sensors in these mobile systems places an increasing demand on both the memory storage as well as the computational power. In this work, we present the \textbf{R}efresh \textbf{E}nabled \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{A}nalytics (REVA) system, an embedded architecture for multi-object scene understanding and tackle the unique opportunities provided by real-time embedded video analytics applications for reducing the DRAM memory refresh energy. We compare our design with the existing design space and show savings of 88.1\% in refresh power and 14.8\% in total power, as compared to a standard DRAM refresh scheme. 
%Results indicate the benefits of utilizing "smart" energy-efficient memories in next-generation real-time visual systems.
